/*
	Some notes about how WordPress processes stuff, hopeful saving you some sanity when trying Gadgets.

	In the Front-end, when WordPress is loaded, all $_GET and $_POST
	are passed through add_magic_quotes() [1] which will then call addslashes() [2]. So if the payload is retrieved from
	$_GET/$_POST/$_REQUEST/get_query_var while WordPress is loaded, it will be escaped, leading to an Offset error when unserialized.
	This should be a rare case, as it would mean that the code of the plugin/theme would not even work with legitimate and harmless serialized data. Workarounds seen done by plugin/theme creators to avoid that: base64_decode()/stripslashes()/wp_unslash() the query var/s.
